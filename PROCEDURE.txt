*FILE INTEGRITY CHECKER*

 
STEP 1: Set Up Eclipse for Python 

1. Install Eclipse IDE for Python Developers (or install PyDev plugin in Eclipse). 

2. Create a new PyDev project: 
      o File → New → Project → PyDev Project → Name it FileIntegrityChecker. 

3. Create a new PyDev Module (Python File): 
      o Right-click on the project → New → PyDev Module → Name it integrity_checker.py. 
 
STEP 2: Python Script (Improved Version) 
    This version: 
    • Stores hash data in a file (hashes.json) 
    • Allows multiple attempts 
    • Detects new, modified, and deleted files 
 
 {//"CODE WILL BE ENTER"//}
 
 
STEP 3: Run in Eclipse 
    1. Right-click the script → Run As → Python Run. 
    2. Enter the directory path (e.g., D:\YourFolder\Demo). 
    3. Run again after making changes to files in that folder. 
 
   
   
What It Does 
    • First run: stores hashes. 
    • Next run: compares old vs new. 
    • Shows: 
          o [NEW] – newly added files 
          o [CHANGED] – modified files 
          o [DELETED] – removed files 
          o [UNCHANGED] – untouched files 
 

We Can Re-run Multiple Times 
    • It will keep comparing with the last saved state (hashes.json). 
    • Make changes in files and re-run to observe the results.
