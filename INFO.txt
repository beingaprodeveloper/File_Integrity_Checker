Project Info:-
       File Integrity Checker 

Internship Task:
Build a tool to monitor file changes by calculating and comparing hash values.

Purpose:
This project helps in detecting changes in files by generating and comparing hash values (SHA-256).
It ensures file integrity and can be used for security or backup validation.

Features:
- Scans files in a selected directory.
- Creates SHA-256 hashes for each file.
- Saves hashes in a file named hashes.json.
- Detects and shows:
    [NEW]      → New files added.
    [CHANGED]  → Files modified.
    [REMOVED]  → Files deleted since last scan.

Technologies Used:
- Python 3.11
- hashlib (built-in Python library)
- json (for storing hash data)

Project Files:
- file_integrity_checker.py : Main Python script
- hashes.json : Sample hash output (optional)
- README.md : Project description and usage guide
- requirements.txt : Python libraries used (optional)
- .gitignore : To ignore unnecessary files (optional)

Status:
Project Completed and Tested Successfully

Note:
This tool is useful for security audits, backup validation, and system integrity checks.
